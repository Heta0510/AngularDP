<form [formGroup]="myForm"></form>
Forms are used to collect and process user input.
The form model is created using angular's 'FormGroup' class.
Reactive Forms,use the 'FormGroup' and 'FormControl' classes to create a model of the form in the component class.
'FormGroup' is used to represents a group of form controls, and 'FormControl' represents an individual form control(e.g,an input field).
